# inh

**ATTENTION** This package is deprecated and is no longer supported. Please, use Isaac's [inherits](https://github.com/isaacs/inherits) package instead.

## The Story

The idea listed below have been moved to [inherits](https://github.com/isaacs/inherits) package version 2.0 (and above) to have exactly one canonical 'inherits' package and don't confuse people by having two options.

## The Idea

[inherits](http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inherits_constructor_superconstructor) for [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)

`inherits` function is used in almost every module. It is located in `util` package and browserify provides you browser-adapted shim of this package. It's good, but the shim is very large, because:

* it contains polyfill to make `inherits` work with old browsers
* it contains a lot of unrelated stuff
* it contains the shim for `process` global, because this unrelated stuff depends on it

browserify produces a lot of supportive code for `util` package. It is ok for large projects, but too much for tiny libraries.

`inh` is aimed to solve this problem. For node.js it just returns standard `inherits` implementation from `util` package, but for browserify it provides browser-specific version (using "browser" key in package.json).

It's recommended to use `inh` in all your code that can be used on client side.

## Usage

npm install inh and then use

```javascript
var inherits = require('inh');
```

instead of

```javascript
var inherits = require('util').inherits;
```
