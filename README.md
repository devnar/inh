# I'm Not Hacker Terminal

Welcome to "I'm Not Hacker Terminal"! This is an open-source development platform designed as a web terminal, enabling developers and enthusiasts to create and enhance their own terminal experience by writing JavaScript code.

Our goal is to foster a collaborative environment where users can contribute to the development of this terminal. By leveraging GitHub's raw file feature, users can upload and run custom scripts seamlessly.

A dedicated Plugins section will soon be available, inviting everyone to contribute their unique functionalities and enhancements to the terminal.
